OVERVIEW OF STIR
Stir is a coffee supplement designed to enhance the morning coffee ritual without altering its flavor.
It focuses on adaptogenic mushrooms to improve energy, mental focus, and reduce the jitters 
and anxiety commonly associated with coffee consumption. Stir is designed for people who love 
their coffee and want to enjoy it their way while reaping the benefits of adaptogens. 
Its seamless integration with coffee offers a unique combination of traditional enjoyment and functional health.

ORIGIN AND INSPIRATION
The idea for Stir was born from the founder's passion for coffee and interest in biohacking and functional health.
Watching their dad enjoy Mud/Wtr sparked curiosity about adaptogenic mushrooms. 
However, the founder wanted to create a product that enhances coffee rather than replacing it. 
Stir was formulated to provide the benefits of adaptogens without compromising on the coffee’s taste, 
delivering a superior coffee-drinking experience for those who prioritize flavor and functionality.
