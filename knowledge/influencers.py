                "OK so i saw one post where you use raw milk. So this is what I believe and you can also check out Barbara O'Neill lectures and videos. She talks about eliminating dairy from our diet. Google has given wrong information about her and even the big  pharma tried to degrade her since she has cure for everything just using things from our nature! Secondly, I personally know people who stopped dairy and their eczema was better, people suffering from Hidradenitis suppurativa also found great changes and their body inflammation was reduced too. So please think before taking milk. Apart from your mother's breast milk, no animal milk is good for humans! And milk is for babies, not for adults. Let the cows babies drink their mother's milk!",

We address stress, sleep, hormones, & emotions, so you\u2019re not stuck masking symptoms forever or putting all your faith in food to heal you. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 REAL LIFE STRATEGY\n\nTHEM: No plan for future. No guidance on reintroducing foods, ditching supplements, or navigating life post-protocol.\n\nME: We strategize YOUR exit strategy. Reintroducing foods w/out fear, skipping supplements w/out falling apart & how to handle life\u2019s curveballs w/out a flare.\u00a0\n\n^THIS is of course, what we do inside gut goddess academy group bc I actually care about you getting results that last years after the program ends \ud83d\udd25",

It concluded that after 12 weeks, participants in the study saw a 35% reduction in wrinkle score and a 24% greater reduction in wrinkles than those on placebo. After 12 weeks, the participants also reported improvements in general skin score and health (9%) as well as increases in elasticity (23%), hydration (14%), radiance (22%), and firmness (25%) against those in the placebo group.\n\u2b50\ufe0fOur Marine Collagen goes an extra step further to ensure that you are getting as many benefits as possible with the incredible proprietary blend of Freshwater Pearl Powder, Tremella Mushroom Extract and Bamboo Silica. \nNot all collagen is created equal, and there are many low quality collagen supplements and sources in the industry. While this study was done on Marine Collagen, the powder was from a farmed, freshwater, warm climate cat fish, which is cheap and less effective than our collagen. We use cold water, wild caught fish from the North Atlantic. Also, many Marine Collagen's on the market have large granules of collagen. This means that their collagen has been agglomerated (processed with gums, starches or inflammatory oils) to appear fluffier, dissolve instantly and remove all smell and taste. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#rootandbones #collagen #marinecollagen #collagenpeptides #hydrolyzedcollagen #skincare #skinhealth #wrinkles #skinessentials #antiaging",

While commonly referred to as \u201cdried orange peel\u201d in English, Chen Pi traditionally comes from tangerines (Citrus reticulata), not oranges (Citrus sinensis).\n\nIn Chinese herbalism and cuisine, the specific variety matters. The most prized Chen Pi is made from Xinhui tangerines (\u65b0\u4f1a\u67d1), a variety known for its thin, aromatic peel and ideal aging properties. While many people casually use orange and tangerine interchangeably in translation, tangerines are smaller, less acidic, and have a more fragrant, complex peel compared to common oranges. This distinction is significant in Traditional Chinese Medicine, where Chen Pi\u2019s warm, aromatic nature makes it excellent for transforming dampness, regulating Qi, and resolving phlegm\u2014properties that may differ if made from standard orange peels.\n\nIn TCM, Chen Pi is categorized as an herb that invigorates the Spleen and Stomach, promoting smoother digestion and relieving bloating, nausea, and food stagnation. It is often prescribed to those experiencing abdominal fullness, poor appetite, or sluggish digestion caused by excessive dampness. Its Qi-regulating effects help alleviate discomfort from emotional stress or stagnation, making it particularly useful for Liver Qi constraint, where tension and digestive issues intertwine.\n\nBeyond digestion, Chen Pi is also a powerful remedy for the Lungs, where it transforms damp-phlegm, making it a key ingredient in formulas for coughs, excessive mucus, and respiratory congestion. It is frequently combined with herbs like ginger or licorice to harmonize the effects and enhance its ability to clear phlegm without being overly drying.\n\nSo, while Chen Pi is often translated as \u201caged orange peel,\u201d it is technically dried tangerine peel\u2014a small but important difference that speaks to centuries of refinement in TCM and Chinese culinary tradition.",

For example, the word \u201cfragrance\u201d may refer to hundreds of different chemicals.\n\nIn addition to containing toxic fragrances, dyes, etc, laundry detergent is designed to stay on your clothes long after they come out of the washer and dryer. This is because companies want their scent to linger so it is\n\"noticeably fresh\". But really, these toxic chemicals are just building up on your sheets, towels and clothing, which make contact with your skin all day and night! This means you're in constant contact with toxins around the clock!!!\nDitch the chemicals. Next time you run out of detergent and dryer sheets, replace them with one of these options instead.

If you want to do with the easy way, just skip the first two steps and use pre-shredded chicken and chicken broth.\n\nstep 1: place a whole pasture-raised chicken (I love @pasturebird or I get from a local farm) in a big pot and cover with filtered water \nstep 2: add salt, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, and cover. simmer on medium-low for 2ish hours until chicken is fully cooked. this is how I make the chicken stock before making the soup! and since the bones are in the chicken, there\u2019s extra collagen goodness \nstep 3: remove the chicken, shred it, and then place it back in the pot with the remaining soup ingredients (make sure the rice has been soaking for 12ish hours to improve digestibility!) and ofc chop all the veggies first. \nstep 4: simmer everything on low for another 30 ish mins and then enjoy \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",

Hormonal Shifts (Mainly Estrogen)\n * Drops in estrogen and/or progesterone shortly before menstruation and low levels during. \n * Rising estrogen after menstruation.\n * Surge of estrogen at ovulation followed by a sharp drop.\n\n2. Histamine Intolerance\n * Elevated histamine levels (common around ovulation and PMS time) can promote estrogen release, creating a feedback loop.\n * Estrogen can reduce the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO), an enzyme that breaks down histamine and upregulate histamine release, while progesterone can suppress DAO, leading to histamine buildup.\n\n3. Gut and Liver Health\n * Poor gut health or dysbiosis can increase histamine production and reduce DAO levels; the gut also plays a critical role in estrogen metabolism (elevated beta glucoronidase levels can be an indicator of imbalance).\n * Liver congestion or dysfunction can impair hormone metabolism detoxification, leading to estrogen dominant headaches.\n\n4. Nutrient Deficiencies\n * Magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, Iodine, Folate, Iron and Manganese deficiencies can worsen headaches by affecting neurotransmitter function, inflammation, and detoxification pathways. Patterns and trends from labs can help reflect bio-individual needs.\n\n5.

Nutrition is the biggest factor in all of this, but with so much hidden poisons in our world it takes just an extra second or two to evaluate what we\u2019re actually eating for optimal health. \n\nMovement & being active is another no-brainer. But it todays world of stagnation and laziness 1 hour at the gym isn\u2019t much. Most people are seated for 8-10+ hours of their day. You need to break your days up with movement. Couple push-ups + body weight squats in the AM, take a walk on your lunch break, gym after work, yoga later, sit-ups before bed. Anyway you can break it up so your body is moving. \n\nSleep, diet, avoiding endocrine disruptors that are all over \u2014 optimizing your health can be hard\u2026 but the biggest factor in it all is not to get too caught up in it all. \n\nLiving stress free should be at the top of the list \u2014 and nothing makes dieting less stressful than frequent bites of steak, fruits, milk, & honey \ud83c\udf6f \ud83e\udd24 \n\nWhat did I miss?\n\nPost inspired by the powerful @homerhelios \n\nShine bright \ud83c\udf1e \n\n#ancestral #primal #holisticwellness #carnivore #healthylifestyle",

His influential \u201cSeven Countries Study\u201d appeared to show a correlation between high-fat diets and heart disease, but it was later criticized for cherry-picking data and ignoring countries where high-fat diets did not lead to high rates of heart disease. Nevertheless, his findings influenced dietary guidelines worldwide.\n\nGovernment Dietary Guidelines and Policy Changes\n\nBy the 1970s, the U.S. government adopted low-fat dietary recommendations, urging people to reduce saturated fat intake and replace it with vegetable oils and carbohydrates. These guidelines were based on observational studies rather than rigorous clinical trials, leading to decades of misinformation about the role of fats in health.\n\nCorporate Influence and Processed Food Industry\n\nThe food industry quickly adapted by promoting low-fat, high-carb processed foods, replacing animal fats with hydrogenated vegetable oils and trans fats. These oils, like soybean and corn oil, were cheaper to produce and had longer shelf lives, making them highly profitable. Margarine, for example, was marketed as a \u201cheart-healthy\u201d alternative to butter, despite later research proving that trans fats are far more harmful than natural saturated fats.\n\nDemonization of Cholesterol and Pharmaceutical Interests\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry also played a role by promoting statins\u2014cholesterol-lowering drugs\u2014as a necessity for preventing heart disease. Since cholesterol is found in animal fats, reducing dietary cholesterol aligned with their business interests, even though newer research suggests dietary cholesterol has little impact on blood cholesterol levels for most people.\n\nIn animal fats we trust \ud83e\uddc8 \n\n#carnivore #primal #ancestral #holistic",

But staying in that perspective, spreading that perspective, isn\u2019t helping anyone. Especially not the people who actually need our help and would benefit from your light. \n\nFeel your feelings, call a shtty situation what it is, feel for your neighbors, and feel for yourself \u2014 but know when to switch, know when your energy is best used elsewhere and don\u2019t second guess your power to positively influence the world even when you feel so small in the face of the chaos. \n\nYOU ARE SO NEEDED. \n\nThank you for being here!

Treasured since ancient times, citrine is known for its association with manifestation, success, and abundance, attracting prosperity to its wearer. \n\nFrom my soul\u2019s dreams to yours, may Starfall be both a talisman and a reminder to bring your dreams to life everyday.  x\n\n\ud83d\udcab",

He was extremely fussy. He nursed a little bit. \n1:15pm: tried to do the first stretches. Got the lip one but couldn\u2019t do the tongue tie. He shut his mouth and I didn\u2019t want to hurt him. I was shaking. For the next hour or so, he wouldn\u2019t take meds, wouldn\u2019t nurse, tried going on a walk in the carrier and he cried the whole time, got home and tried to get him to sleep and he wouldn\u2019t. \n2:15pm: all of a sudden he let me read him a book and I put him on the floor and he seemed super content playing. He was drooling a ton but didn\u2019t cry at all. I started to worry that I\u2019d have to express milk and get him to drink it from a cup. \n3:20pm: \u2728Finally\u2728 got him to nurse to sleep. He woke up once fussing and wouldn\u2019t nurse back to sleep so I held him and bounced him until he fell back asleep. \n4:30 woke up super fussy, couldn\u2019t nurse back to sleep. Hung out with Dad and played with wood toys. Listened to music. Hasn\u2019t pooped all day at this point. Nursed a little bit then played with dad more. \n\nContinued in comments",

                "Mia, I know you know this but I wanted to reiterate- you absolutely did the right thing for Theo. I\u2019m an SLP and provide myofunctional therapy to children with narrow vaulted palates as a result of unresolved oral ties which prevent proper facial development and lead to speech delays as well as a myriad of other long term difficulties. The procedure itself is def much harder on the mama than the baby- my daughter had lip, buccal, and tongue ties revised at 1 month old and it was pretty challenging for me but so worth it ultimately for her. She was able to nurse for 27 months. Like others have said, continue doing the stretches and if you aren\u2019t already, go for a few chiro visits while his little body adjusts to the new tongue mobility and overall fascia release. Hugs and props to you mama for doing the hard things\ud83e\ude77"

I mostly consume the green, enjoy the yellow without issue and avoid the red. The further down the pipeline the further away from real nourishing healing food. \n\nPeople had an issue with the fact I brought up Quaker Oats in my last video. What people do not understand is the issue brought up in the article was social justice - that marginalized groups do not have access to real Whole Foods and that we should stop telling people how harmful it is to consume UPFS bc that\u2019s what they have. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t agree that we should shut up about it - I do think the wellness community forgets to meet people where they\u2019re at. If someone lives in a food desert where it\u2019s easier to grab McDonald\u2019s vs go to the supermarket bc there\u2019s little to no fresh food. I\u2019d rather someone pick up an item with minimally processed ingredients that\u2019s ready made (instant oats or canned goods) REGARDLESS of it being organic or glyphosate free. 1. They probably don\u2019t even have access to that & 2. When you\u2019re not consuming nutrient dense foods - nutrients are more important than it being 100% organic. That\u2019s my personal hot take but as a health coach we\u2019re taught to meet people where they\u2019re at so they CAN start implementing healthier habits and gaining confidence back to eat real food. \n\nOfc if you\u2019re in the financial space and have access to glyphosate free foods - please do so but don\u2019t compare your level 50 to someone\u2019s level 1. Y\u2019all are missing the plot. In the grand scheme of things people are told even oats are toxic so they might as well enjoy the meals they like that are cheaper. THATS what we\u2019re up against. \n\nYes pesticides, toxins, glyphosate are all important but NOT for the groups of people who struggle to just simple eat simple foods.",

This tilt causes the seasonal variations in sunlight that we experience, with longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter.\n\n\t\u2022\tHowever, over the course of a year, the Earth\u2019s rotation ensures that day and night eventually balance out to an average of 12 hours each per day.\n\n\t2.\tSeasonal Variations Cancel Out:\n\t\u2022\tAt the equator, days and nights are almost equal all year (around 12 hours each).\n\n\t\u2022\tNear the poles, there are extreme variations, with months of continuous daylight in summer and darkness in winter. But these extremes balance out over the year\u2014resulting in an annual total of sunlight comparable to other parts of the planet.\n\n\t3.\tEnergy Distribution:\n\n\t\u2022\tWhile the intensity of sunlight (due to angle and atmospheric interference) varies by location, the amount of time sunlight is available across a year remains constant.\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2600\ufe0f\nEvery place on Earth receives the same total hours of sunlight annually\u2014it\u2019s just distributed differently based on latitude and season.

Adequate exposure to bright light, especially during the morning, helps signal to the brain that it\u2019s time to be alert and active. This process primarily occurs through light exposure to the eyes, which influences the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain, the master clock of the circadian system.\n\n* Low Lux (Dim Light): Insufficient light exposure, especially in the morning, can disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to sleep disorders, fatigue, and impaired hormone regulation.\n\n* Study - 2,500 Lux in the morning is needed for healthy metabolism - https://lnkd.in/eMtK2vjf\n\n* Study - 2,500 Lux is needed to support conditions like depression & anxiety - https://lnkd.in/e5hegbKk\n\n* On a clear, sunny day, the maximum lux level can reach approximately 100,000 lux when standing outdoors in direct sunlight. This level can vary slightly depending on geographical location, altitude, and time of year, but 100,000 lux is a typical peak measurement for full sunlight around midday.\n\n\ud83c\udf12 \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udfff",

We see this nonstop, but it\u2019s the constant posts about parasite cleansing that irks me the most.\n\nParasite cleansing trends are everywhere right now, with people promoting 10-day full moon cleanses like they\u2019re the ultimate solution. But here\u2019s the thing: a full moon cleanse is a maintenance protocol, not a healing protocol. If your body is in desperate need of a deeper healing phase, jumping straight into a cleanse like that isn\u2019t just ineffective\u2014it can be dangerous.\n\nWhy? Because true parasite cleansing requires:\u2028\u2728 A strong foundation of nourishment to support detox.\u2028\u2728 Thoroughly opened drainage pathways to ensure toxins can leave the body.\u2028\u2728 Nervous system resourcing to hold the big emotional infections that get stirred up during cleansing!\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: even the most aggressive parasite cleanse will fail if you don\u2019t address the reasons why your body became such a hospitable environment for parasites in the first place. Parasites thrive in an imbalanced terrain\u2014so if you don\u2019t heal the physical, emotional, and spiritual roots of that imbalance, they\u2019ll keep coming back.\n\nThis is why you\u2019re frustrated. You\u2019ve been trying everything\u2014the trends, the cleanses, the supplements\u2014yet nothing sticks. That\u2019s because true healing isn\u2019t found in quick fixes; it\u2019s found in a holistic, bio-individual approach that sees the entire picture of your health.\n\nThis is the work we do inside my signature root cause healing program Hormone Glow Up. HGU is the most advanced multidimensional women\u2019s healing program on the market. We go the deepest\u2014addressing your physiology, subconscious patterns, emotional wounds, and spiritual alignment to unlock the healing your body was designed truly designed for.\n\nEnrollment for HGU 2025 cohort opens soon, but the waitlist is now live.

I booked a session with my energy healer at the time for extra support and had the most profound 90 minute healing of my life. The session turned deeply ancestral - energetic cord cutting, somatic releasing and crying out pain that was never mine to begin with. An hour after my session I really had to go to the bathroom. \ud83d\ude33 To my complete and utter surprise, I looked down and found that I released THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of dead parasites in the toilet. Mind you, I was not on any form of parasite cleansing protocol whatsoever. This was the catalyst of how you see me teach physiological, emotional, energetic and ancestral health integration today.\n\nIn my work, the \u201cphysical\u201d tools lead to energetic clearings and the \u201cenergetic\u201d tools lead to physical clearings. Most people will preach that you only need one or the other, but the fact is we need both. Our healing plan must address our multidimensional nature, period.\n\nMost spiritually advanced people totally miss the fact that focusing on nourishment, minerals, circadian biology, blood sugar, drainage pathways, etc builds the CAPACITY for your body to actually be able to process and integrate deep energetic healing.\n\nMost \u201cscience\u201d robots stuck completely in the logic of 3D completely bypass the energetic layers contributing to so much physical distress in the first place.\n\nMy superpower is merging these worlds in a way we\u2019ve never seen done before, and I have thousands of student success stories to back it up.\n\nMany people find me in hope of healing gut, hormone, metabolic or chronic health issues and experience a massive spiritual awakening and \u201chomecoming\u201d in the process. Multidimensional parasite cleansing the way I teach takes this journey to a whole other level.\n\nI do not offer a stand alone parasite cleanse offering, and only teach parasite cleansing as part of my full root cause healing methodology as parasite cleansing should never ever be a starting place!

Your health is your vessel for clarity, sovereignty, and alignment. When we heal ourselves, we shift the trajectory for everyone around us.\n\nBut so often, we tell ourselves we\u2019ll focus on our health \u2018when we have more time,\u2019 \u2018when life settles down,\u2019 or \u2018when we\u2019re less busy.\u2019 Let me say this plainly: there is nothing more important than your health.

The truth is, supplements aren\u2019t the solution\u2014they\u2019re the cherry on top.\n\nHow you eat is just as important as what you eat.

Yet, we often skip these foundational steps because they don\u2019t come in shiny packaging or promise overnight results.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: true healing doesn\u2019t live in the quick fixes. It requires us to get to the roots\u2014the physical, emotional, and spiritual reasons we became imbalanced in the first place.\n\nYes, supplements can be helpful, but they aren\u2019t the healing plan. They supplement a lifestyle-based healing plan that addresses the deeper layers of dysfunction. If you\u2019re serious about your health, you need to look beyond what\u2019s on your plate and start addressing:\n\u2728 Chronic nervous system dysregulation\u2028\u2728 Unprocessed trauma and emotional toxicity\u2028\u2728 Circadian rhythm disruption\u2028\u2728 Mineral depletion and cellular starvation\n\u2728 Blood sugar dysregulation\u2028\u2728 High toxin load, sluggish drainage, and parasites!\n\nThis is exactly the level of depth we go to inside my signature root cause healing program Hormone Glow Up - the most advanced women\u2019s healing program on the market.

This will be a ONE TIME ONLY free masterclass that you don\u2019t want to miss so comment TRUTH below or head to the link in bio to grab your spot. \ud83e\ude75\u2028\u2028While parasite cleansing is an essential piece of the root cause healing puzzle, you need to understand that it is absolutely not a starting place. There\u2019s an incredibly important \u201corder of operations\u201d to be followed & parasite cleansing is an advanced step. Additionally, if you do not address all the physical, emotional & spiritual reasons why your body became so hospitable to parasite overgrowths in the first place, they will just continue to come back after all your cleansing efforts.\n\nThere are going to be people who don\u2019t read this caption & pummel me in the comments w/ all forms of \u201cPARASITE CLEANSING IS NONSENSE. YOU JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON YOUR TERRAIN!\u201d To this I say - optimizing your internal terrain is nonnegotiable. Health 101. \ud83e\udee0 I say this quite literally in every post I\u2019ve ever written about parasites/cleansing. AND!!! Parasite cleansing is going to be important for most people on top of foundational terrain work. I\u2019m tired of the conversations that are so black & white, this or that. All can be true.\n\nMost people on this app screaming that it\u2019s only the terrain have never worked with a client or patient in their life. As someone who has supported THOUSANDS of chronically ill women for over a decade I know that parasite cleansing is essential for multidimensional healing.\n\nInside The Truth About Parasites masterclass on September 12 I\u2019m going to share everything I can\u2019t share on here without getting c3ns0red, and expand on all of the nuances that rarely get discussed. I\u2019m going to be diving so so deep into both the physiological and quantum aspects of parasites, and will blow your mind when I explain why parasite cleansing is key to the collective shift in consciousness we all desire. \ud83e\uddec\u2728\ud83e\udd0d\n\nComment TRUTH to register now. Can\u2019t wait to see you there!\n\n#parasites #parasitecleanse #selfhealers",

However traditional diets have prioritized QUALITY, by encouraging people to seek out nutrient-density and prized foods.\n\nWhile brainstorming what would best help you, I have come to realize that a shopping list would be sending you on a wild goose chase. You would be forced to question all of the options in our modern \"hunting grounds\", as our local options/accessibility varies.\n\nSo instead I will teach you how to find everything you need to know to get the highest quality foods in your area. \n\nI teach the questions to ask, how to find the answers, and what exactly we are looking for when sourcing to gauge a foods' nutrient-density and purity.\n\nThis is the equivalence to me raiding your fridge/pantry, then taking you grocery shopping.\n\nI will show you the ropes to sourcing and choosing the highest quality foods in your area. You will follow-along with the comprehensive food sourcing worksheet to have mapped out the highest quality options within a reasonable radius of your zip code. \n\nWith lifetime access the interactive masterclass outline, you will be able to source nutrient-dense food where ever you go, having all of my tools up your sleeve.\n\nI listed all of the necessary pantry swaps to replace sources of modern toxins that you might not have considered. \n\nAfter this comprehensive food sourcing makeover, your fridge/freezer/pantry will be stocked with the highest-quality foods for feeling your best. \n\nThese foods were prized, yet their popularized replacements have led us into degenerating health. \n\nThis is the first-step to preparing high-quality, nutrient-dense meals. \n\n#animalbased #regenerativeagriculture #pastureraised #rawmilk #redmeat #nutrientdensity #ancestralhealth",

I\u2019m always switching it up.\n\nBut with the steaks, I make them like this every\u2026 single\u2026 time\u2026 because they are phenomenal every\u2026 single\u2026 time\u2026\n\nI do however usually use regular tallow. But I used whipped bone marrow for this most recent steak because I had it on hand and it was the greatest venison I have ever had. I had to share this recipe done exactly like this.\n\nCooking game meat is a difficult skill to perfect. It\u2019s common to end up tasting gamey, dry, and chewy \u2014 mostly due to how lean it is.\n\nSo here\u2019s my step-by-step instructions on how to avoid this. \ud83e\udd8c\n\n#venison #gamemeat #redmeat #gamerecipes #wildvenison #nourishingtraditions #ancestralhealth #animalbased #westonaprice #animalfats \n\nDo you like game meat? \ud83e\udd8c\ud83e\uddac\ud83e\udece\ud83d\udc17\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd83",

I decided to build this into my website. This will be up whenever you'd like to have at it \u2014 forever. You can start it whenever you'd like, as long as Day One is on a Monday (due to how I scheduled it).\n\nI've made it just $21.00 because I'd like anyone and everyone to be able to get after it. That's just $1.00 per day AND free access for a lifetime with all of the resources I provided inside (links, recipes, guides, lessons... etc.)\n\nI've also made it very easy to navigate on both a laptop & a phone. This set-up is similar to my Masterclass \u2013 just more calendar-like. There is a progress bar at the top which fills up after you hit \"Complete & Continue\" on a day. You'll have all days unlocked from the get-go if you'd like to look ahead to plan out your week.\n\nI am so excited to have this done before the New Year because it makes for a great way to kick it off!\n\nThank you always for all of your support and trust in me.

Spread out 6 horizontally cut beef bones (or 3 vertically cut beef bones)\n\n2. Roast at 450\u00b0F for 30 minutes until the centers are bubbling \n\n3. Remove from the oven carefully and let cool for 10 minutes\n\n4. Grab each bone with tongs and remove the center bone marrows with a spoon or knife and place them into a small glass. Ensure to also pour the oils melted into the pan into your glass. This is the bulk of the fat that will be whipped. Freeze the bones for a broth later on.\n\n5. Strain what you have removed with a cheese cloth until you have a uniform, clean oil. Add a pinch of unrefined salt.\n\n6. In a larger bowl of ice water, set your bowl of oil inside. Do not let the ice water into the oil, vice versa.\n\n7. With a handheld mixer, whip the oil until it has become opaque, thick, and whipped. It should look like frosting.\n\n8.

It\u2019s also a great source of protein\u2028\u2028\ud83d\udc2eSources of gelatin: \n- Bone broth\n- Collagenous cuts of meat (chuck roast, skin on chicken)\n- Gelatin powder (make gummies, lattes, etc.)\n\nPlus, gelatin offers benefits for hair & nail health as well as promoting gut health and better digestion.

To help others in need. \n\nI have never met such wholesome people in my life and they\u2019ve accepted me with open arms. \n\nGetting to watch the love of my life be the best big brother to the most amazing humans is such a privilege. \n\nAt 19 & 20, Zach\u2019s two youngest brothers have true provider mentalities that you won\u2019t see in most grown men these days.

He\u2019s rock solid in himself and his values. He provides spiritual and emotional security as well so that you can relax into your feminine and really blossom creatively and as a woman. He doesn\u2019t create anxiety, uncertainty, and fear. He creates a sense of safety in your soul in a way that nourishes every cell in your body. His love is pure and fierce. \n\nHis masculinity is the yin to your femininity yang. \n\nRise to become the level of partner you want to attract and settle for nothing less. \n\n#masculinity #divinemasculine #fyp #alpha #sigma #god #christiantiktok",

This should be common knowledge by now. \n\nUnfortunately hospitals can be the exact opposite unless you  have a very special provider. Here, you might experience constant monitoring, fluorescent lights, medical students learning by using your body at the most sacred and vulnerable moment in a woman\u2019s life, being treated like an idiot, told what to do, given internal exams without consent, injured, lied to, viewed as an inconvenience and inherently flawed in your female design, my god the list goes on forever honestly. \n\nI\u2019ve heard good stories and I have heard exponentially more horror stories from hospitals some even from birth center births. \n\nAnd I\u2019ll be honest with you, before I began my journey of learning about birth and subsequently becoming a birth doula/photographer, I totally thought I would want the meds when I gave birth in a hospital some day too because I was terrified of birth. I think most women are because not only are we wildly uneducated about the actual physiology of birth and how our bodies truly function, we are severely conditioned by the media, elders and our peers to fear the birth process. \n\nNow present day, I can\u2019t wait for the births of my future children. Birth is supposed to push you past all your limits. It\u2019s an unavoidable part of the experience in order to bring you to your knees and surrender to faith that your body knows how to meet your child face to face. It\u2019s meant for you to come out as the strongest version of yourself so that you can be the best mother you can. And your body has what what it needs to ride those waves unless interferes with lab created chemicals that literally block your body\u2019s ability to produce its own endorphins and oxytocin. \n\nYour body knows what it\u2019s doing but it needs to feel SAFE in order to do so. \n\nAnd it\u2019s so damn cool. \n\nMom\u2019s have the most important job on earth. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \n\n#birth #homebirth #pregnancy",

Soaking breaks this down, making those nutrients more bioavailable.\n\n\u2728 Easier to Digest: Soaking starts breaking down complex starches and proteins, making rice gentler on the gut and easier for your body to process. This is especially helpful for those with sensitive digestion or bloating issues.\n\n\u2728 Faster, Nutrient-Preserving Cooking: Soaking softens the grains, reducing cooking time and protecting heat-sensitive nutrients. Plus, it ensures the rice cooks evenly without sticking together.\n\nTo soak: rinse the rice, cover with water (add lemon juice or vinegar for a mineral boost), soak 6-12 hours, rinse again, and cook. \n\nIf rice makes you feel bloated, you might not need to cut it out! You might just need to learn how to prepare it! \n\n#nourishingtraditions #guthealthtips #realfood #ancestralhealing #healthyliving #nontoxic #nontoxicliving",

Sometimes, letting go is the most healing thing you can do.\n\nDoes this resonate with you? \u2728",

You can have it all, I promise, but make sure you\u2019re prioritizing your wellness to prevent burnout \n\ncortisol is already highest in the morning, you don\u2019t want to spike it even further by consuming coffee first thing. have some salt water first, a high protein bfast, delay your caffeine intake 60-90 mins after waking and enjoy your coffee without any of the jitters \n\nIncorporate quality protein into your diet to support satiety, hormone balance, muscle building & longevity. Ditch the processed fake meats and enjoy a grassfed steak packed with protein, vitamins & minerals, steak is a superfood! \n\nMake 2025 your year to swap out beauty products & household cleaning products that don\u2019t contain endocrine disruptors \n\nFocus on ingredients in your food > counting your calories. There\u2019s a ton of additives in our food these days so focus on one ingredient foods that will support your overall health and leave you feeling satisfied \n\nDitch the HIIT and focus on low impact workouts, strength training and watch how much better you feel! You will have more energy, see better results, and fat will start to melt off \n\nCarbs are your friend! focus on quality protein, carbs & healthy fats with each meal to support bloodsugar balance. You\u2019ll notice you won\u2019t need to eat as much because nutrient dense whole foods will keep you satiated throughout the day \n\nStop skipping breakfast! If you aren\u2019t hungry when you wake up it\u2019s a sign of high cortisol. Start prioritizing quality sleep, bloodsugar balanced meals. Aim to get 30-50g of protein in with bfast\n\nStop hopping on your phone first thing in the AM and get outside and get some sunshine to balance your cortisol & improve your sleep.

This way you\u2019re in control of what\u2019s going into your body. \nSeek out a holistic health Dr or nutritionist ASAP so you don\u2019t have to guess (bloodwork) holistic practitioners tend to check for far more than a traditional doctor \nStart your day with warm salt water & lemon or I love @drinklmnt to hydrate and replenish those electrolytes \nPrioritize sleep (quality 7-8 hours/night) have a relaxing nighttime routine: no screens within 30 minutes of going to bed, tart cherry juice, read a nice book \nPrioritize your protein intake (1g per pound of body weight) easy ways to get in protein: steak & veggies, chicken & veggies, protein shake \nMeditation is one of the greatest forms of self care you can give yourself - take ten mins in the am to devote to a meditation practice \nBe patient with yourself \nShow yourself more love \n\n1 year later and I\u2019m finally feeling like myself again. \n\n#postpill #birthcontrol #birthcontrolproblems #healing #healingjourney #holistichealth #holistichealing #foodismedicine #lifestyle #nutrition #guthealth #hormonehealth #selflove #selfcare #wellness #sunshineisthebestmedicine #movementismedicine #holistichealing #migrainefree #healthiswealth #balancedhormones #cyclesyncing",

No - unless you want to, but for most women I work with I find this creates unnecessary stress & overwhelm. I like to focus on overarching nutrition principles: \n\nMenstrual phase: \nFocus on iron-rich foods to replenish iron stores. This is a great time for grass fed red meat and leafy greens. Vitamin-C rich foods, like oranges, kiwis & bell peppers, can help to enhance absorption of iron. I love warming foods, like soups & chili during this phase!\n\nFollicular phase: \nThis phase resembles our inner spring. Light & fresh foods are often preferred for this phase. Appetite may also be lower during this phase in the cycle, so remember to nourish!\n\nOvulatory phase: \nBrassica family vegetables, like broccoli & brussel sprouts can help to support estrogen metabolism. Antioxidants & anti-inflammatory support are also helpful during this phase - colorful fruits & veggies and spices like turmeric. \n\nLuteal phase: \nBlood sugar balance is crucial in this phase as we are more sensitive to blood sugar swings before our period. Focusing on building meals with a balance of high quality protein, healthy fat, carbs & fiber is key. Magnesium rich foods also may help reduce cravings. \n\n#hormonehealth #hormonalhealth #cyclesyncing \n\nNote: this is not medical advice only health education",

The free electrons gathered from grounding will boost testosterone levels\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Avoid blue light at night \ud83d\udc49 this will chronically raise cortisol, lowering testosterone levels \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Shilajit \ud83d\udc49 studies show that Shilajit can enhance the secretion of luteinizing hormone, which signals the testes to produce testosterone \n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Manage stress \ud83d\udc49 chronic stress will raise cortisol and systemic inflammation, negatively impacting testosterone production \n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Oysters \ud83d\udc49 oysters are rich in zinc which is a critical micronutrient for testosterone production\n\n8\ufe0f\u20e3 Mitigate nnemf \ud83d\udc49 Non native EMF puts major stress on our mitochondria which are responsible for the synthesis of pregnenolone, the precursor of testosterone \n\n9\ufe0f\u20e3 Lift weight (preferably outside) \ud83d\udc49 lifting weights activates muscle fibers which signals testosterone production. Bonus points if you do it outside in the sun while grounding. \n\n\ud83d\udd1f Avoid polyester clothing \ud83d\udc49 polyester clothing contains microplastics which can be absorbed into your bloodstream, completely messing with your hormones, including testosterone \n\n#testosterone #menshealth #hormones #healthyhormones #shilajit #shilajitbenefits #energy #vitality #circadianrhythm #circadianbiology #optimalperformance #lowtestosterone #libido #lowlibido",

The spark in my eyes is gone. I believed that I would never have real answers and would be dealing with these health issues for the rest of my life.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how much can change in a few years. In the right picture, I\u2019m thriving. I\u2019m consuming foods that serve my body. Any extra weight that I was carrying off effortlessly melted off. The symptoms listed above are completely gone or managed. I both feel and look better in my body. \n\nHow did I do it? With the healing power of food and lifestyle changes. My diet is focused around whole foods, mostly fruits and veggies. Juices and herbs are my medicine. I drink clean water, breathe clean air, and reduce my exposure to toxic chemicals. I practice mindfulness, gratitude, and manage my stress. \n\nIf I can do it, so can you! If you\u2019re thinking about making lifestyle changes but don\u2019t know where to start, I started an online healing community to help you get started on your journey.

Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil, onion, carrots, salt, pepper, and oregano. Cook for 10 minutes. \n2. Add the garlic, bay leaves, chicken, and broth and bring the temperature to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, bring to medium heat and cook for 15 minutes, or until chicken is done. \n3. Once the chicken is cooked, take it out and shred it (love the mixer trick for this step). Remove and discard the bay leaves from the soup too. \n4. Add the orzo and let it cook for 8 minutes. \n5. In the meantime, add your lemon juice and eggs together. Once combined, add a 1/2 cup of soup to the mixture, and then pour it all into the soup. \n6. Add the chicken back into the soup and turn the temperature to low. \n7. Let the soup simmer for 5 minutes and add the dill. \n8.

So here is my little guide to help you on your journey! \n\nThe right herbs can be incredible allies during this time, offering natural support for everything from morning sickness to postpartum recovery.\n\nIn this guide, I\u2019ve broken down pregnancy-safe herbs by trimester, highlighting how each can help nourish, calm, and strengthen your body through every stage. \ud83c\udf38\n\n\u2728 First Trimester: Think gentle digestion and calming the nerves.\u2028\u2728 Second Trimester: Focus on building nutrients and balancing stress.\u2028\u2728 Third Trimester: Strengthen, prepare for labor, and rest deeply.\u2028\u2728 Postpartum: Heal, restore, and support breastfeeding.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Remember: Every body is different, and herbs can affect us uniquely. If you are not working under an herbalist, I would suggest only using herbs in teas. If you do work 1-on-1, an herbalist can help increase dosing. Always check with your healthcare provider before incorporating herbs into your pregnancy routine, and pay attention to how your body responds.\ud83d\udc95 This post is for informational purposes only, and none of the information shared should be taken as medical advice. \n\nWhich herbs have been most helpful to you during pregnancy (or postpartum)?

The body can always detox. \n\n(Or will always be trying to) \n\nAnywho! \n\nThese are just some of the natural practices and foods I use as therapy to support my body and mind with all the holistic knowledge I\u2019ve acquired in my 10 year journey healing and searching for the root cause of IBD. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 10 years but I truly believe the best is yet to come for my health :,) \n\nI always welcome any questions about how I\u2019ve been navigating this complex situation between having no choice but to rely on infusion therapy to keep me functioning and using natural practices to heal and address root cause. \n\nI started this account a few years ago to show how I had been able to maintain remission through diet and lifestyle. \n\nAfter so many years, it just wasn\u2019t enough. And that\u2019s okay. Well, it\u2019s not but I had to learn radical acceptance and drive to continue pushing on regardless of my circumstances<3 \n\nThrough this experience I\u2019ve lost everything I thought I knew, but gained entire of wealth of knowledge about the many complex factors that all interconnect playing a role in the root cause of the dis-ease I experience. \n\nThe only side effect I\u2019ve noticed from these infusions is a feeling of nausea following right after and through the day. I stick to foods that are soft and less work for my body to digest, allowing it to save energy for other vital processes while prioritizing foods that are also nutrient dense. I try my best to get in enough calories for my body to utilize for healing by choosing higher calorie, lower volume foods. My body is getting the energy it needs without having to digest large qualities of matter\n\nAs always, with love \ud83c\udf80",

I\u2019ve always found avocado to be so cooling and soothing on my skin, especially after sitting in refrigeration. \n\n-Raw honey\ud83c\udf6f\n\nHoney is a humectant, so it attracts and retains moisture by drawing water into the outer layer of the skin\n\n-Pastured egg yolk\ud83c\udf73\n\nArguably the star of the show. Egg yolks are like little nutrient bombs for both inside and outside of your body. They\u2019re full of fat-soluble vitamins like A&E, and have anti microbial properties which can strengthen your skin microbiome <3 \n\n-Organic Oats \ud83c\udf5a (no glyphosate on your face) @onedegreeorganics has certified glyphosate free organic sprouted oats. \n\nThe ancient Egyptians were among the first to use oatmeal in baths to help with skin irritation. Its high in saponins, which gently cleanse the skin without stripping its natural oils and microbiome.\n\n\ud83e\udd51Measure with your heart, that\u2019s what I do! It\u2019s more about consistency. Add a splash of water if you need to when blending. \n\n\ud83e\udd51It keeps for about a week in the fridge.\n\n\ud83e\udd51I apply a thin layer and let it dry completely before gently exfoliating it off with a clean rag. \n\n\ud83e\udd51I then apply some fresh aloe Vera followed by grass-fed beef tallow and that\u2019s about the closest I\u2019ll get to washing my face!\n\nMy mother and I always used to have what we would call \u2018face mask parties\u2019 growing up and we would pull back our hair, put on a face mask, do each others nails, and watch extreme home make-over with some freshly washed grapes. \n\nLooking back, this was such a beautiful practice of self-care and connection between mother and daughter that she was teaching me. \n\nWe would craft our own homemade face masks often using avocado or oats which is where this recipe originated from. \n\nAlso may I add, nothing has ever made my skin feel so soft. Any time my skin feels irritated, dry, breaking out, or just because I love myself, I\u2019ll make this wonderful concoction and the next day my skin glows \ud83c\udf1e\n\nYour skin is your largest organ, don\u2019t feed it anything you wouldn\u2019t eat\ud83e\udd65\ud83e\udd51\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf47",

In the male body, it will support testosterone production and balance out excess estrogen. For the female body, testosterone production won\u2019t be affected UNLESS it needs to be for your own personal hormonal regulation. \nShilajit works with the intelligence of the body to reach your version of balance and health.\n\nMost who use it regularly notice higher (and more regulated) energy levels, better sleep, hair and nail growth, faster recovery, higher libidos \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 and increased vitality.\n\nYou already know that @blacklotusshilajit is my only trusted source for this powerhouse, and you can use the code ZAHIYAH15 to try it for yourself this month \ud83c\udf3f\n\n#consciousrelationships #bluecollarboys #bluecollarlife #hippiewife #relateable #holistichealth #testoteronehealth #hormoneimbalance #shilajit #trt #balancedhormones #ayurveda",

Let cool slightly so water doesn\u2019t boil over \n8.add 3 cups water, or until cast iron is almost full but you can still lift without spilling \n9. Place in oven with a cookie sheet on top so you do not fully lock in the water \n10. Bake for 3 hours, check periodically to ensure water has not evaporated.

We\u2019ve been around for a while but many of you have probably never heard of us! \n\nSo, here\u2019s our quick start guide.\n\nWe focus on cellular health, all 70+ trillion of them. Whether you\u2019re someone who\u2019s healthy or suffer from a chronic illness, the health of our cells is critical to the quality of our healthspan.\n\nSo, if you are just starting out with us, here are the 3 products we are really known for and the 3 that started BodyBio over 30 years ago:\n\n1. BodyBio PC: phospholipids make up our cell membrane. Why is our cell membrane important? Well, it literally acts like the brain our of cell (for more on this, check out @brucelipton\u2019s work). As we age, and with toxic insult, we need more phospholipids to help our cell membrane perform it\u2019s best. My grandfather figured out a way to isolate and extract the main phospholipids into what we have today, BodyBio PC.\n\n2. Balance Oil: the perfect blend of the mother essential fatty acids, ALA and LA in an organic and unadulterated form to prevent oxidation. This provides the healthy oils your cells need for fluidity and structure. Balancing your EFAs is not as simple as slamming fish oil and hoping to offset bad eating habits. Avoid rancid vegetable oils and supplement with healthy EFAs to balance out your 6:3 ratio (the idea ratio is 4:1).\n\n3. Butyrate: is an essential end product of a healthy microbiome. Primarily, it fuels your gut cells, strengthening the gut lining and healing leaky gut. Many of us are low in butyrate because of antibiotic use, environmental toxins, and lack of resistant starch in our diet. We need specific bacteria to ferment specific starches to create butyrate and it\u2019s getting harder to do on your own these days!\n\nSo welcome! We are so happy to have you join us on our mission to improve each and every one of your cells and organelles \ud83e\udd1d\n\n#supplements #supplementsthatwork #healthylifestyle #naturalmedicine #health #healthy #healthyandhappy #cells #cellularhealth #cellularlevelhealth #biohacking #brucelipton",

Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nLime improves acidity levels in the stomach and stimulates the release of bile. Sea salt provides the chloride your body needs to produce stomach acid. The combo will help your body digest food, absorb nutrients, and contribute to natural weight loss. Lime water has an antioxidant property which eliminates harmful toxins and keeps blood purified \u2728\n\nThe adrenals rely heavily on sodium to function properly. Salt is crucial to stress management and energy levels because it nourishes and supports the adrenals. The combination of salt, lime and water have alkalising and hydrating effects, which are vital for the optimal functioning of our body systems. One of the most effective ways to get more energy in the morning is to reset your circadian rhythm by drinking a glass of water with lime and salt in the morning (regulate cortisol levels!)\n\nA lime, filtered water and salt drink contain electrolytes, making it an excellent way to fight dehydration, especially after sleeping. Your body uses and loses salt and minerals when you sleep. Drinks with electrolytes replenish sodium and nutrients and hydrate the body to prevent dehydration effects like fatigue. \ud83d\ude34\n\nQuite literally the best way to start your morning- and you likely have ingredients on hand. I do recommend a high quality Celtic sea salt- I have some linked in my Amazon page! \n\n#thedailybalance #hydration #water #celticseasalt #naturesgatorade #minerals #electrolytes #morningroutine #habits #healthyliving #adrenalhealth",

It just takes a few months of consistency to turn habits into sustainable routines. \n\nI remember going through it after I got off the pill and had liiiterally no idea what was happening to me. It felt so isolating- nobody (that I followed) was talking about hormones, or cortisol, or the nervous system. That, combined with a high stress job that I hated, and years of habits I deemed \u201chealthy\u201d because they were trendy- because if they worked for one person, they should work for me? \ud83d\ude44 \n\nWellness is not one size fits all. Everyone has their own things that work for them- and if you don\u2019t know where to start or you feel like you\u2019re doing everything right with no results- that\u2019s where I come in.

A kidney deficiency (cold womb) is associated with painful periods & fertility struggles. Other symptoms might include low energy, low libido, short luteal phase & low progesterone. \n\nIs wearing a warm pair of slippers or socks going to fix ALL of these issues? Obviously not. We need to look at lifestyle, nourishment, toxin levels etc. But warmth in general is a KEY component to fertility. Warm foods, warm drinks, warm feet = a happier & healthier womb. And there have been testimonials of women having less period pain, increasing serum progesterone levels etc. JUST from wearing socks 24-7 (yes, even to sleep!). So why not give it a try & see what happens! \n\nAlso I highlyyyy recomend some real wool slippers or socks, not polyester! \n\n#fertility #pms #hormonebalance #hormoneimbalance #pcos #infertility #pregnancy #nervoussystem #chinesemedicine #warmwomb #pregnancyafterloss #pregnancyjourney #rainbowbaby",

When healing, I realized how important our living environment really is. Living and sleeping in an environment with tons of artificial light, artificial fragrances, potential mold, off gassing from toxic paint & furniture, excess dust, as well as drinking and bathing in unfiltered water, is a recipe for chronic health issues. Of course, getting outside as often as possible is KEY to a vibrant & healthy lifestyle, but focusing on creating a healthy home is just as important unless you plan to sleep outside \ud83d\ude02\n\n#healthyhome #moldillness #moldtoxicity #cirs #moldillnessrecovery #nontoxic #lowtox #airpurifier #circadianrhythm #waterfilter #healthyhormones #hormonehealth #metabolichealth",

So when we came across these Twix bars, we were skeptical\u2026BUT THANK GOSH we made them.

In a mixing bowl, add all ingredients for the shortbread layer and stir until a dough forms. Press into the parchment lined pan evenly. Bake for 10 minutes until golden brown at the edges, then cool for 10 minutes.\u2028\nWhile the shortbread layer is baking and cooling, make the caramel sauce. Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and stir continuously at low/medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside until the shortbread layer is ready. Pour the caramel over the shortbread layer, and spread evenly. Freeze until set.\u2028\nUsing a double boiler, melt together chocolate chips and coconut oil for the chocolate layer. When your caramel filling layer is set, pour chocolate and evenly spread. Freeze again until the chocolate is hard.

Life gets busy, you\u2019re at the office late, traffic was brutal, etc. etc\u2026 the list can go on and on for reasons why you \u201cdon\u2019t have time\u201d to make a healthy, home cooked meal. \n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why we have started to meal prep some of the most time consuming parts of healthy eating: washing & chopping veggies and fruits. Plus, everything is stored perfectly in our @caraway_home non-toxic containers. \n\nThis simple habit is an absolute game changer when it comes to healthy eating. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\u2014 Healthy Eating, Simplified: When your ingredients are prepped, dinner is so much easier and faster to whip up\u2014no more excuses to order out!\u2028\u2014 Smart Snacking: Having veggies ready to go means I can grab carrots and hummus (stored in the Caraway Dot & Dash cups!) instead of less nutritious options.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about why Caraway is our go-to for food storage:\u2028\nMost plastic containers are made with toxic chemicals like BPA, which can leach into your food. These \u201cforever chemicals\u201d have been linked to hormone disruption, cancer, and infertility\u2014noooo thank you!\n\u2028Caraway containers are 100% non-toxic, eco-friendly, and designed to keep your food safe and fresh. Plus, they look so chic in the fridge!\n\nIf your 2025 goals are to eat healthier, make small changes that last, and feel good in your body, follow us @everythingkrause for tips on clean eating, toxin-free swaps, and simple recipes that make healthy living easy. \ud83e\udef6\n\nReady to make the switch?

We were by no means perfect, & there was still so much to learn (as there always is). I will say it IS sweeter when it\u2019s not allowed, & there were instances where I would have the \u201ctreats\u201d we never had at our house, but then I would feel so horrible because it\u2019s simply not the food I am used to. I literally grew up on strictly homemade food (foreign parents lol) In my house it wasn\u2019t about what foods weren\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d, I was just taught that certain choices were unhealthy & why. Yes good & bad foods did & do exist in my house & I\u2019m very grateful for it because if we\u2019re going to sit there & pretend it\u2019s okay for young children to guzzle down pop every single day then we\u2019re going to have to end up explaining to them why mommy & daddy allowed them to once they\u2019ve developed extreme cravings, food addiction, & chronic disease. This is the reality of today\u2019s children & it\u2019s horrifying. Also, idk if it\u2019s coincidence but I had made friends with girls whose parents had similar philosophies & it was really easy to connect through this & lean on each other, have our homemade weird-looking lunches together, etc. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f All this goes to say, I was taught by example & philosophies around eating, living naturally, etc. rather than sat down & told \u201cthis is good & this is not allowed\u201d. I was given the information through my parents practicing what they preached & given the chance to create my own ideas with this, & let me tell you.

If there\u2019s one thing I wish I did WAY sooner when I was dealing with chronic health issues, it\u2019s functional testing to help me identify the underlying reasons why my body felt off.\n\nThere are soo so many amazing tools that we can use that can benefit our health, but the thing is we are all wired differently, and bio-individuality is key.\n\nJust because you see one person online raving about one supplement, one specific diet, one routine etc working for them, it doesn\u2019t always mean that\u2019s exactly what YOUR body needs. This is why functional lab testing is so important\n\nI started working with KD because I wanted to get a better understanding of why some of my symptoms were popping up, and to start focusing on some hormone optimization\n\nWe started with a gut microbiome test which alone was able to tell me specific imbalances that were present in my gut, and I just started my first protocol last week! \n\nThere\u2019s a ton of wellness trends out there and yes it can be insanely overwhelming, but if there\u2019s one thing to note it\u2019s this: \n\nGet back to the basics (whole foods, getting outside, daily movement, quality sleep, stress management). It\u2019s amazing to incorporate more practices into your routine, but get the foundations down first - the stress of trying to be perfect with it will do more harm than good \n\n\ud83e\udd6cIf you\u2019re interested in going on a health journey with @kalediagnostics , comment \u201cHEALTH\u201d and I\u2019ll send you a code to save! \n\nYour health is a lifelong marathon, not a sprint \ud83d\udc9b\n\n#wellnesstrends #kalepartner #holistichealthcare #holistichealthandwellness #holistichealthtips",

This was SO important as a Hashimoto\u2019s gal who had conditions and infections suppressed as a kid (ie lots of ant!biotics, steroids, etc)\n\n-addressing light rhythms - sunlight on bare eyes first thing, soft lighting after dark, little to no screens after dark, mimicking the sun\u2019s patterns, etc\n\n-eating as locally and seasonally as possible\n\n- support detox with things like lymphatic support, castor oil, etc\n\n-this is of course on top of my normal rhythms of regular and balanced meal combination and timing (just like outlined in my meal plans!) + deeply nourishing foods (like in my cookbooks!)\n\nAnd this is still not fully comprehensive - again, this is built on years and years of habits and rhythms.\n\nBut I really was shocked at the role functional testing played. As a girl who has done \u201ceverything right\u201c and was able to come off thyroid medication years ago, I was still fighting for my antibodies to come down and really feel like I found some of the missing pieces!

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve always been there, but I was never intentional enough to look for them. Once I started loving myself, I began noticing more love around me. At first I thought it was coincidence, but now I truly believe they are reminders and intentional signs. I often feel lonely, but somehow each one is a reminder I\u2019m never alone. YOU are never alone. \n\nBeing alone is a physical state, but loneliness is a mental one \u2014\u2014\u2014 so start changing the narrative! A season of loneliness or isolation is the stage a caterpillar gets its wings, remember that! Trade the pressure of being perfect for the peace of living freely.\nBe present. \nVibe alone.\nBecome your own best friend. \nNotice things around you. \n& work on LOVING the person within you. \n\nYou can\u2019t hate yourself into a body you love, it\u2019s hard to heal your relationship with food through demonizing it, and you won\u2019t see growth until you commit to change. In any area of life!\n\nPeople always ask me how I am so positive and the truth is, I\u2019m not. A lot of the time the reminders I share for you are the reminders I\u2019m telling myself. I\u2019m on a journey of my own and I have hard days too, but just because something is hard doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth it. \n\nAs we enter the month of love, whether you\u2019re in a relationship or not- you have so much love to give to others and yourself. I challenge you to look for it all around you and find peace from within you. \nHappy Feb\u2763\ufe0f",

I was 19, and it answered so many questions for me \ud83d\udc8c \n\nWe expect our bodies and the earth to always be in fruition, this is unsustainable. Here are the four internal seasons explained so we can begin healing the collective feminine together \u2763\ufe0f\n\n\ud83c\udf19Day 1 starts on the first full day of our period and lasts for roughly 4-7 days. Our hormones are at their lowest points, this gives us low energy and it\u2019s important to rest rather than push through these intuitive calls. This is our internal winter. \n\n\ud83c\udf19Then from our periods until ovulation (roughly 7-10 days) we are in our internal spring because our body\u2019s temperature is rising along with estrogen and FSH, this gives us more energy and a desire to turn outwards. \n\n\ud83c\udf19Ovulation occurs about 2 weeks after our period and lasts for 12-36 hours, however the Ovulatory phase is characterized by a 3-5 day window to mark our fertile time. Our body temperate rises and peaks along with energy and our hormones such as LH, estrogen, and testosterone. This is our internal summer. \n\n\ud83c\udf19Finally we have our luteal phase which is the longest of them all lasting from ovulation until our moon arrives again. This is our internal fall as our egg transforms into the corpus luteum and tells our body to begin producing progesterone, a calming and cooling hormone. Our hormones rise and fall here which can make us emotionally sensitive and increases our appetite. \ud83d\udc9b \n\nI\u2019m going to be sharing an in depth video on each of these internal seasons and how to support our fluctuating bodies throughout it all, so stay tuned \ud83e\udec2\ud83d\udc8c\u262f\ufe0f #cyclesyncing #internalseasons #menstrualcycle #womensupportingwomen #seasonalliving #tcm #cyclicalliving #womanhood",

Christ's heaven is immeasurable, I need to be there instead of this world where disease, poverty, strife, famine, etc. exist. I'm sure you enjoy the temporary wealth you get from having lots of followers, sadly i doubt it's feeding a starving african in the opposite situation as you.\n10. Jesus said, \"I have cast fire upon the world, and look, I'm guarding it until it blazes.\"\n16.\u00a0Jesus said, \"Perhaps people think that I have come to cast peace upon the world. They do not know that I have come to cast conflicts upon the earth: fire, sword, war.\"\n21. \"As for you, then, be on guard against the world. Prepare yourselves with great strength, so the robbers can't find a way to get to you, for the trouble you expect will come.\"\n27.\u00a0\"If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the (Father's) kingdom. If you do not observe the sabbath as a sabbath you will not see the Father.\"\n28.\u00a0Jesus said, \"I took my stand in the midst of the world, and in flesh I appeared to them. I found them all drunk, and I did not find any of them thirsty. My soul ached for the children of humanity, because they are blind in their hearts and do not see, for they came into the world empty, and they also seek to depart from the world empty.\n56.\u00a0Jesus said, \"Whoever has come to know the world has discovered a carcass, and whoever has discovered a carcass, of that person the world is not worthy.\"\n80.\u00a0Jesus said, \"Whoever has come to know the world has discovered the body, and whoever has discovered the body, of that one the world is not worthy.\"\n110.\u00a0Jesus said, \"Let one who has found the world, and has become wealthy, renounce the world.\"\n111.\u00a0Jesus said, \"The heavens and the earth will roll up in your presence, and whoever is living from the living one will not see death.\"\nDoes not Jesus say, \"Those who have found themselves, of them the world is not worthy\"?",

I was always fascinated by how certain foods impacted my performance, energy and body composition. \n\nLike most young women, I was then on the rollercoaster of experimenting with basically every diet under the sun. \n\nI tried paleo, vegan, keto, high carb low fat, intermittent fasting.. you name it I\u2019ve done it \ud83d\ude02. \n\nOver time, and after years of being vegan (which is not necessarily to blame but is a big part of my journey) I found myself with a myriad of digestive and hormonal issues. \n\nI was constantly bloated and uncomfortable, had lost my period, my hair was falling out, I had no energy, my skin was horrible, and I had developed sensitivities to seemingly every food. \n\nI couldn\u2019t understand how this \u201cperfect\u201d diet I was eating at the time was making me so unhealthy, and that set me on a path to learn about bio individuality and how there really is no one \u201cperfect\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d diet for everyone. \n\nThrough the process of healing my own body I became so passionate about health and nutrition and decided to pursue a career to become a Holistic Nutritionist. \n\nAs humans we are so multifaceted, and to bring our bodies back into balance it truly takes a holistic approach of nutrition, mindset, lifestyle, and spirituality - whatever that means to you. \n\nMy intention is to help teach you about how your body works, to bring a balanced approach back to health and wellness, and to help you realize that you do have the power to change. \n\nI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here, let\u2019s continue to get better together \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd0d",
